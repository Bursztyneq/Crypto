Nosana- the only decentralized CI/CD platform, powered by the Solana Network, and fueled by the NOS token.

Nosana leverages the Proof-of-History consensus of the Solana Network to build out decentralized software pipelines. CI by the people, for the people!
The platform combines edge-computing and blockchain functionality into a CI/CD marketplace. The NOS token fuels the system by creating an open marketplace. People and machine can use and share compute power to execute their software delivery pipelines.

Nosana pipelines, and phases of developement, consist of 3 individual steps. Which will be developed and released after each other.

Nosana Test Suite, The "Nosana Test Suite" to test assert the codeâ€™s correctness before integration.
Nosana Delivery and Deployment Suite, The "Nosana Release Suite" to build, test and scan your software
Nosana DAO, The "Nosana DAO" helps shape the future of the platform.
